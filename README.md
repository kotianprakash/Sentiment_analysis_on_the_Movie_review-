# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

This is a project aimed at classifying the sentiment of movie reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset used for this project is the IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset.

The project is divided into two main parts: data preprocessing and model building. In the data preprocessing part, the raw text data is cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed into numerical features that can be used as input to a machine learning model. In the model building part, several machine learning models are trained and evaluated on the processed data to classify the sentiment of the movie reviews.
